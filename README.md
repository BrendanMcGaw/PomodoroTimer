Timer for the pomodoro study technique.

# The Pomodoro Technique.
My custom pomodoro timer is made for all those fat cats out there getting distracted by too many things. Garfield is here to help you get back on track and nail that essay!

# How it works...
This timer starts at 25:00 minutes. It counts down to 00:00. Once it hits zero it will play a sound indicative of your completion of 25 minutes worth of study. It will then open up a new timer for 5 minutes of break time, do what you want during this period but be ready to start again when the timer ends, you don't want to break that streak!


# Wikipedia Description:
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo[1] in the late 1980s.The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

# //TODO:

# Add long break after 4 25 minute study sessions.
# Add double digits to each html element for visual representation.
